### Preparing to Teach
 
We __highly recommend__ you begin preparing your lessons before you start teaching. 

When you prepare, you should: 

*	Update slides for each lesson, so they match your style of teaching.

*	Review solutions and make sure you agree with the way it was coded. Keep in mind students coding level, but __don't share code you don't agree with__.

*	Review all curriculum materials and think about how you would like to apply your teaching style and professional experience to the classroom.
